Query: the scene is very dense. there are vehicles on the different sides of the center car. most cars are moving in fast speed. the center car turns left.

Output:
Summary: The ego vehicle (V1) turns left in a dense traffic scenario with multiple vehicles on the right back side. Because the scenario is very dense, there should be narrow roads and more vehicles. We put 8 vehicels in a two-lane two-way road with an intersection ahead.
Explanation: 
- V1 (ego vehicle) is in the center and turns left. V1 turns left, so its speed is slow and set to be 5m/s (index 2). It turns left, so its actions are all 1 (turn left).
- V2-V5 are on the right back side of V1, so their positions are 2 (back right), distances are determined by the scenario, directions are 0 (parallel_same), and speeds are slow. They keep going straight, and keep speed.
- V6 is also on the right back side of V1 but slightly further away, so its position is 2 (back right), distance is determined by the scenario, direction is 0 (parallel_same), and speed is slow.
- Map: This happens in a two-lane two-way road, the ego vehicle is on the left-turn lane with lane id 1. There is an intersection with a two-way road around 10 meters (index 2) ahead as ego vehicle is turning left.
