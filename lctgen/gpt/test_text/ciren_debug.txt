This crash occurred during daylight hours on a dry, bituminous divided trafficway (median strip without positive barrier) under clear skies.   There were four east travel lanes (two through lanes, one left turn and one right turn) and four west travel lanes (two through lanes, one left and one right).   The east lanes have a slight right curve and the west lanes curve slightly to the left.  Both east/west travel lanes were level grade at point of impact and divided by a grass median.   The speed limit at this location is 80km/h (50 mph).  The intersecting north/south roadway consisted of one north travel lane and three south travel lanes (one through lanes, one left and one right).  These travel lanes were divided by a raised concrete median on the northern side of the intersection.  This intersection is controlled by overhead traffic signals. A 2017 Dodge Grand Caravan (V1) was traveling east in the left turn lane and a 2006 Nissan Sentra (V2) was traveling west in the left through lane.  As V1 was traveling east it attempted to execute a left turn to travel north when its front bumper impacted the front bumper of V2 (Event 1).   After initial impact, V1 rotated counterclockwise approximately 80 degrees before traveling to its final resting position in the middle of the intersection facing north.  V2 was traveling west in the left through lane and attempting to travel through the intersection when its front bumper impacted the front bumper of V1.   After initial impact V2 rotated clockwise approximately 20 degrees before traveling to its final resting position in the middle of the intersection facing northwest.  V1 and V2 were towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash
