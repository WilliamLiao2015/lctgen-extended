(ciren_732) A 2018 Nissan Versa sedan (V1) was traveling north in the right lane, passing over the hillcrest.  A 2019 Nissan Frontier pickup (V2) was stopped ahead of V1 in the same travel.  It is unknown if the driver of V2 was waiting for other traffic ahead or waiting to turn left into the driveway at the area of impact.   The front of V1 impacted the back plane of V2 in a rear-end configuration (Event 1), leaving a 30 cm gouge in the road.  V1 and V2 traveled a short distance in the northbound lane before coming to rest in the roadway.  V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage.  V2 was removed by its owner

(ciren_702) A 2021 Subaru Forester compact utility (V1) was traveling north in the right lane of two negotiating the left curve at approximately 53 km/h (33 mph). Pre-crash data from the EDR suggests she intended to continue straight through the intersection to proceed to the highway on-ramp on the other side. A 2021 Kenworth tractor-trailer (V2) was traveling west in the second lane of three and intending to continue straight through the intersection. Police estimated V2\u2019s travel speed as 56 km/h (35 mph).   Vehicle 1 entered the intersection without slowing for the stop sign and was struck on the right plane by V2\u2019s front (Event 1). Both vehicles then traveled towards the shoulder in the northwest corner of the intersection. The front of V2 struck a guardrail end terminal (Event 2) before coming to rest in the roadside northwest of the intersection. Vehicle 1 struck the guardrail\u2019s face (Event 3) before coming to rest on the westbound shoulder of the road. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage.

(ciren_687) This two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of an eight-lane divided trafficway and a two-lane roadway during daytime hours. The roads were asphalt, dry, and controlled by traffic signals. There were four lanes for the northbound and southbound traffic, including left and right turn-only lanes for both travel directions. The northbound lanes were level and the southbound lanes had a grade of 2%. The speed limit was 72 kmph (45 mph) in the north/south lanes. Vehicle 2, a 2020 Ford Escape utility vehicle, was traveling southbound (north to south) in the outside straight-through lane. As V1 attempted to turn left at the intersection, its front was contacted by the front of V2 (Event 1). After impact, both vehicles were redirected slightly southwest. After the initial contact, V1 rotated counterclockwise while V2 rotated clockwise. Vehicle 1 came to rest facing southwest and V2 came to rest facing west. Both vehicles were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
